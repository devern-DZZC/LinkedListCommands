# LinkedListCommands

This is a school assignment that I completed.

There are 5 lists in all for this assignment and each listâ€™s data is
stored on a separate line (terminated by -1) and all list data are terminated by -999.
After -999, there is a set of commands that are to be processed using the array of pointers to linked
lists. In summary, I was required to store the linked list data in locations of an array of pointers,
then process the list of commands
